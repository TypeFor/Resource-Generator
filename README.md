# Resource-Generator
This is a resource generator created with node.js for FiveM which just creates empty resources.
I made this just for fun and i know it's actually useful ... not ðŸ™ƒ.

## Set Up

1. Download the resource generator.
2. Do the resource generator in the folder in which the resources folder is inside. 
3. Configure the config.json.
4. Install node.js.
5. just run the start.bat
6. Have fun with endless resources.
